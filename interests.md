I am deeply interested in Robotics and AI ML, especially how computer vision and intelligent multi agent systems can improve automation,healthcare,space and defense.  
I enjoy learning ROS2,simulation tools like Gazebo and frameworks such as MoveIt to understand real robotic behaviour and plan to implement realistic Robo hand and other mechanism after success in simulation and learning to code it thoroughly 
I also love being a part of tech communities that promote learning, collaboration and women empowerment in STEM
