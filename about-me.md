Hello, I am Raksha Vindya A, a sophomore at VIT Bhopal University, pursuing B.Tech in CSE (Core).  
I am a huge enthusiast of Robotics and AI-ML engineering.  
I admire the club's reputation for conducting events and workshops that provide knowledge and hands-on experience for tackling real world problems through innovative solutions.  
By applying to be part of the Women Tech Team, I would love to be involved in a community where we can share insights, stay updated with emerging technologies and promote women’s inclusion in tech.
